    <section id="About">
        <p>Dance is my favourite hobby because tt improves my strength and flexibility and I have healthier muscles and joints. Better posture and body balance because I do dancing regularly. Dancing is the gateway to different cultures in the globe. Dancing helps me to interact with new people that improves my communication skills as well. Dancing allows me to express myself. A sense of community is found within the dance. Dancing provides physical/mental refreshment and relaxation. Laughter and funâ€”dancing provides me a lot of entertainment.</p>
